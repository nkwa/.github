# Nkwa Community Files

This repository contains the default community health files for the Nkwa project. These files help set standards for contribution, conduct, and communication across all Nkwa repositories.

## What's Included

- **[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**: Our expectations for how community members interact
- **[Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)**: How to contribute to Nkwa projects
- **Issue Templates**: Standardized templates for reporting bugs and requesting features
  - [Bug Report Template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md)
  - [Feature Request Template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.md)

## How It Works

These files will automatically apply to any [@nkwa](https://github.com/nkwa) repository that doesn't include its own version of these files. This ensures consistency across our projects while allowing individual repositories to customize when needed.

## More Information

For more details on how default community health files work in GitHub, see the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
